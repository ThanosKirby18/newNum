Advanced Java Topics 

Febuary 18 2022

This project was based completly upon the Cyber Dojo Kata by the name of newNum. The goal of this lesson was to master the use of jUnit testing and practice solving 
problems with a case by case approach. THe goal of this particular kata that I choose was to recieve a number and return its text form. I was only able to get the 
program to work in the thousands place

More Info : This was an assignment for the Advanced Java Topics course. I had recieved a lot of help from my classmates and teacher. Thoruoght this project I encontered 
many problems involving code and the way I was coding. I Failed my jUnit tests - 71 times, I encountered an error 51 times and I succeded 26 times.
